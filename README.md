# JobScraper

A python webscraping project using Selenium to gather data across different job aggregators. Google Sheets API is then used to record the collected job data. CRON is then used to schedule program execution once a week ensuring that a new sheet is created with updated job listings.

## Motivations

This project was developed to help the Professional and Career Development Manager of the Child and Adolescent Studies Student Association at California State University, Fullerton, an organization aimed towards helping students find promising career opportunities.

The project solves the problem of having to manually query postings from multiple job agregators cutting out the active work required to search for listings and allowing the user to focus on determining the quality of each opportunity.
